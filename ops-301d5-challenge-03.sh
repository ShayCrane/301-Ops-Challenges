# Script: Ops Challenge Class 03 - System Info 
# Author: Shay Crane
# Date of latest revisions 09/01/2022
# Purpose: Creates a bash script that launches a menu system with the following options for the user to choose from: 

# - prints Hello World to the screen
# - ping self (pings this computerâ€™s loopback address)
# - IP info (print the network adapter information for this computer)
# - exits script

# Parts of the script were inspired by: 
# - https://linuxhint.com/bash_conditional_statement/
# - https://askubuntu.com/questions/1705/how-can-i-create-a-select-menu-in-a-shell-script

# The script does not loop, but I got these very simple commands working. 

echo "Options Menu:" 
echo "  1) Print: Hello World!" 
echo "  2) Ping Loopback" 
echo "  3) Network Adapter Info" 
echo "  4) Exit"

read NUM
if [ $NUM -eq 1 ]; then 
    echo "Hello World!"
elif [ $NUM -eq 2 ]; then
    ping -c 5 127.0.0.1
elif [ $NUM -eq 3 ]; then
    ifconfig
# elif [ $NUM -eq 4 ]; then
else    
    echo "You have exited the menu."
    exit 0 
fi
