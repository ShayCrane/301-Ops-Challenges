# Script: Ops Challenge Class 03 - System Info 
# Author: Shay Crane
# Date of latest revisions 09/01/2022
# Purpose: Creates a bash script that launches a menu system with the following options for the user to choose from: 

# - prints Hello World to the screen
# - ping self (pings this computerâ€™s loopback address)
# - IP info (print the network adapter information for this computer)
# - exits script

# Parts of the script were inspired by: 
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/1705/how-can-i-create-a-select-menu-in-a-shell-script

# I have completely overhauled my original script.  I've left both previous versions below the working script for review.  

PS3='Please enter your choice: '
